# Oregon Essentialized Assessment Framework (EAF) – Science

Oregon Essentialized Assessment Framework (EAF) 
Science Grades 5, 8 and High School 
 
About This Document 
This document presents Oregon’s updated Essentialized Assessment Framework (EAF), for Oregon’s Alternate Assessment, based on 
the Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (AA-AAAS) for Science, organized by grade level and aligned with the most current 
state academic content standards. The AA-AAAS are essentialized versions of Oregon’s general education standards, systematically 
reduced in depth, breadth, and complexity to ensure meaningful access for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, as 
required by Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015). 
Each page is structured to serve as a clear, practical tool for classroom planning and instructional decision-making and includes the 
<div class="table-container">
| following: |
</div>
• 
Source Standard: The original or updated Oregon grade-level academic content standard that provides the academic foundation 
for each AA-AAAS. 
• 
Alternate Academic Achievement Standard (AA-AAAS): A carefully essentialized version of the source standard, developed 
using Oregon’s validated SCORE process (Select, COde, Reduce, Essentialize) to maintain the core intent while removing 
barriers to access. 
• 
Low, Medium, and High (L, M, H) Parameters: Defined ranges of complexity that guide how each AA-AAAS can be taught 
and assessed at levels appropriate to individual student abilities and needs. 
 
Approach to Non-Essentialized Standards 
In linkage with established practice for alternate academic achievement standards, not all general education source standards are 
essentialized for inclusion in this document. The essentialization process focuses on selecting and adapting standards that can be 
clearly linked to observable skills and measured reliably within the structure of Oregon’s Extended Assessment. A list of source 
<div class="table-container">
| standard codes that were reviewed but not essentialized is included on the last page of this document. | Educators may refer to |
| Oregon’s published content standards for the full description and context of these codes. |
</div>

How to Use This Document 
This resource is designed to be an instructional planning companion for teachers, specialists, and support staff delivering meaningful 
academic instruction aligned with the Oregon Extended Assessment (ORExt). Unlike previous versions distributed in Excel format, 
this PDF is streamlined and organized for ease of use, based on direct feedback from Oregon educators. 
Teachers are encouraged to use the Source Standards for context, the AA-AAAS for instructional targets, and the L/M/H parameters 
to scaffold lessons and adjust complexity, ensuring each student has an appropriately challenging and accessible pathway toward 
grade-level expectations.

For additional support in implementing the AA-AAAS or for questions about alignment and instruction, please contact the Oregon 
Department of Education or visit ODE’s Alternate Assessment webpage.

Equivalent ODE Standard: 5-ESS1-1 
 
 
Oregon Science Standard 2022: 
Support an argument that the apparent brightness of the Sun and 
stars is due to their relative distances from Earth. 
 
Oregon Science Standard Clarifications/Assessment Boundary 
2022: 
[Clarification Statement: Emphasis is to obtain information and 
construct an explanation on how the scale of the distance to 
objects giving off light affects the brightness of objects (e.g. 
nearby streetlights appear bigger and brighter than distant 
streetlights).] 
[Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to relative 
distances, not sizes, of stars. Assessment does not include other 
factors that affect apparent brightness (such as stellar masses, age, 
and stage).] 
 
 
Oregon Alternate Academic Achievement Standard 
(Essentialized Standard): 
Recognize that the Sun is brighter than other objects on Earth 
and in space. 
 
Low (L), Medium (M), High (H) Parameters: 
L: Questions ask about the Sun being brighter than other 
common objects that do not shine on their own (e.g., toy, ball, 
<div class="table-container">
| rock). |
</div>
M: Questions ask about the Sun being brighter than other 
objects in sky or space that are not as bright (e.g., clouds, 
<div class="table-container">
| airplanes, rockets, birds, Moon, other stars, planets). |
</div>
H: Questions ask about the Sun being brighter than other stars 
in space because it is closer to the Earth.

associated with nighttime), including that shadows typically 
<div class="table-container">
| happen during the daytime. |
</div>
M: Questions use simple pictures and diagrams to ask about 
shadows that occur during the daytime (e.g., 
<div class="table-container">
| occurrence/direction/size of shadows based on position of Sun). |
</div>
H: Questions use simple pictures and diagrams to ask about the
