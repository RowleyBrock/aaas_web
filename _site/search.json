The AA-AAAS are essentialized versions of Oregon’s general education standards, systematically reduced in depth, breadth, and complexity to ensure meaningful access for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, as required by Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015). For Mathematics, the Key Scope used to guide item writing and L/M/H parameters is also provided.\nEach page is structured to serve as a clear, practical tool for classroom planning and instructional decision-making and includes the following:\n• Source Standard: The original or updated Oregon grade-level academic content standard that provides the academic foundation for each AA-AAAS. • Alternate Academic Achievement Standard (AA-AAAS): A carefully essentialized version of the source standard, developed using Oregon’s validated SCORE process (Select, COde, Reduce, Essentialize) to maintain the core intent while removing barriers to access. • Low, Medium, and High (L, M, H) Parameters: Defined ranges of complexity that guide how each AA-AAAS can be taught and assessed at levels appropriate to individual student abilities and needs.\nApproach to Non-Essentialized Standards In linkage with established practice for alternate academic achievement standards, not all general education source standards are essentialized for inclusion in this document. The essentialization process focuses on selecting and adapting standards that can be clearly linked to observable skills and measured reliably within the structure of Oregon’s Extended Assessment. A list of source\nCopyright Behavioral Research and Teaching (BRT) 2025 standard codes that were reviewed but not essentialized is included on the last page of this document. Educators may refer to Oregon’s published content standards for the full description and context of these codes.\nHow to Use This Document This resource is designed to be an instructional planning companion for teachers, specialists, and support staff delivering meaningful academic instruction aligned with the Oregon Extended Assessment (ORExt). Unlike previous versions distributed in Excel format, this PDF is streamlined and organized for ease of use, based on direct feedback from Oregon educators. Teachers are encouraged to use the Source Standards for context, the AA-AAAS for instructional targets, and the L/M/H parameters to scaffold lessons and adjust complexity, ensuring each student has an appropriately challenging and accessible pathway toward grade- level expectations.\nContact For additional support in implementing the AA-AAAS or for questions about alignment and instruction, please contact the Oregon Department of Education or visit ODE’s Alternate Assessment webpage.\nMathematics Key Scope by Grade Level Copyright Behavioral Research and Teaching (BRT) 2025 KEY Abbreviation Definition A Addition S Subtraction M Multiplication D Division Grade Content Area Scope 3 Numbers Whole numbers: 1 to 20 3 Fractions 1/2 3 Operations Addition and Subtraction (within 1-10);

The AA-AAAS are essentialized versions of Oregon’s general education standards, systematically reduced in depth, breadth, and complexity to ensure meaningful access for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, as required by Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015). Each page is structured to serve as a clear, practical tool for classroom planning and instructional decision-making and includes the following:\n• Source Standard: The original or updated Oregon grade-level academic content standard that provides the academic foundation for each AA-AAAS. • Alternate Academic Achievement Standard (AA-AAAS): A carefully essentialized version of the source standard, developed using Oregon’s validated SCORE process (Select, COde, Reduce, Essentialize) to maintain the core intent while removing barriers to access. • Low, Medium, and High (L, M, H) Parameters: Defined ranges of complexity that guide how each AA-AAAS can be taught and assessed at levels appropriate to individual student abilities and needs.\nApproach to Non-Essentialized Standards In linkage with established practice for alternate academic achievement standards, not all general education source standards are essentialized for inclusion in this document. The essentialization process focuses on selecting and adapting standards that can be clearly linked to observable skills and measured reliably within the structure of Oregon’s Extended Assessment. A list of source standard codes that were reviewed but not essentialized is included on the last page of this document. Educators may refer to Oregon’s published content standards for the full description and context of these codes.\nCopyright Behavioral Research and Teaching (BRT) 2025\nHow to Use This Document This resource is designed to be an instructional planning companion for teachers, specialists, and support staff delivering meaningful academic instruction aligned with the Oregon Extended Assessment (ORExt). Unlike previous versions distributed in Excel format, this PDF is streamlined and organized for ease of use, based on direct feedback from Oregon educators. Teachers are encouraged to use the Source Standards for context, the AA-AAAS for instructional targets, and the L/M/H parameters to scaffold lessons and adjust complexity, ensuring each student has an appropriately challenging and accessible pathway toward grade- level expectations.\nContact For additional support in implementing the AA-AAAS or for questions about alignment and instruction, please contact the Oregon Department of Education or visit ODE’s Alternate Assessment webpage.\nELA Grade 3 Copyright Behavioral Research and Teaching (BRT) 2025 ORExt Standard Code Equivalent OR Standard Code 2019 Oregon English Language Arts and Literacy Standard Oregon Alternate Academic Achievement Standard (Essentialized Standard) Low (L), Medium (M), High (H)\nParameters L.3.L.1.1.a 3.L.1a, 3.L.1b, 3.L.1c, 3.L.1d, 3.L.1e, 3.L.1f, 3.L.1g, L.1h, 3.L.1i Identify , explain, and use nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
